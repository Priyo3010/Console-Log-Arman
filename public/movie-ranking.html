<h1>The best movies according to Arman</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>
  I liked the hunger of Jordan Belfort. And how he built his empire through
  trading
</p>
<h3>Kill Bill</h3>
<p>
  This is a movie that I enjoyed every inch. It never makes me feel bored
  watching a Tarantino movie
</p>
<h3>Slumdog Millionaire</h3>
<p>
  Danny Boyle has served the best gift to us with this gem. I's always an
  inspiration how he portrayed Jamaal Malik's story.

<h4>Okay then</h4>
